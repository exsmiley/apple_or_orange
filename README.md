# Apple or Orange

This is a project to help me learn tensorflow. It tries to classify pictures of apples and oranges!

### Methodology

  - scrape pictures of apples and oranges from Google to form a training set
  - resize all of the pictures to the same size so that they can be fed in as vectors of the same size
  - use some sort of convolutional neural network to perform the classification task

### Results

Let's see how this goes! :smirk:
